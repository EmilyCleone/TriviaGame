In this game user presses the start button to begin the game. Once the user clicks "start" the start button is hidden on the display and the browser will now show each of the questions with their associated buttons to answer. The timer also appears at the top of the screen starting at 120 seconds and counts down by one second at a time. This clock will time out at 0.
Once the timer runs out game will automatically display the scoreboard and show the number of answers answered correcly, incorrectly, and left unanswered. 
The page will also switch once the user clicks "submit".
